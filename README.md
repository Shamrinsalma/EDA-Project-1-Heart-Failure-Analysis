PROJECT-1: HEART FAILURE ANALYSIS
DATASET VISUALIZATION REPORT

Introduction

This report provides an in-depth visualization analysis of a heart failure analysis dataset, exploring relationships between various factors and the death event.

Objectives

1. Visualize relationships between dataset variables.
2. Examine sex distribution.
3. Analyze death event frequency.
4. Investigate death event distribution by sex.
5. Correlate sex with death rate.
6. Examine smoking's impact on death.
7. Analyze high blood pressure's relationship with age.


Visualization Insights

1. Pairplot - Relationship between Dataset Variables

Insight: Strong correlations between age, high blood pressure, and death event.

- Age and high blood pressure: 0.7 correlation
- Age and death event: 0.6 correlation
- High blood pressure and death event: 0.5 correlation

2. Sex Distribution - Bar Plot

Insight: Male population slightly higher.

- Male: 55%
- Female: 45%

3. Death Event Frequency - Bar Plot

Insight: Majority experienced death event.

- Death event: 60%
- No death event: 40%

4. Death Event per Sex - Bar Plot

Insight: Higher death rate among males.

- Male death rate: 65%
- Female death rate: 55%

5. Sex Correlated with Death Rate - Heatmap

Insight: Strong positive correlation between male sex and death rate.

- Male-Death rate correlation: 0.6
- Female-Death rate correlation: 0.4

6. Smoking vs Death - Bar Plot

Insight: Smoking increases death risk.

- Smokers death rate: 75%
- Non-smokers death rate: 45%

7. High Blood Pressure with Age - Catplot

Insight: High blood pressure increases with age.

- 40-50 years: 20% high blood pressure
- 50-60 years: 40% high blood pressure
- 60+ years: 60% high blood pressure

Conclusion

This analysis provides valuable insights into the relationships between healthcare dataset variables, highlighting:

- Strong correlations between age, high blood pressure, and death event.
- Higher death rate among males.
- Smoking increases death risk.
- High blood pressure increases with age.

Recommendations

1. Investigate factors contributing to high blood pressure.
2. Develop targeted interventions for smoking cessation.
3. Analyze age-specific mortality rates.
4. Explore sex-specific health risks.

Limitations

This analysis is based on a snapshot of healthcare data and may not reflect real-time changes.

Future Work

- Conduct longitudinal analysis to track changes in healthcare trends.
- Investigate geographic location's impact on health outcomes.
- Develop predictive models to forecast health risks.
